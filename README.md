# Phase field precipitate aging model

Phase field model for precipitate aging in ternary analogues to Ni-based
superalloys. This is WORK IN PROGRESS with unresolved performance,
implementation, and design flaws. It is posted publicly as the output of a
long-term, ongoing, federally funded research project, for reference and
differential analysis only.

## Background

This repository contains a phase-field model for solid-state
transformations in Inconel 625 based on [Zhou *et al.*](#zhou-2014), which
involves a ternary generalization of the binary [KKS model](#kim-1999).

To capture δ and λ intermetallic precipitates in a γ matrix, I have chosen the
ternary Cr-Nb-Ni system. The three-phase three-component model is represented
using two composition fields (Cr and Nb) and two phase fields (δ and λ). There
is one dependent composition (Ni) and one dependent phase (γ). Based on
[ASTM F3056](#astm-f3056), combining Cr with Mo under the assumption that their
influences on the alloy are similar, this codebase considers system compositions
between (Ni--0.0202 Nb--0.2794 Cr) and (Ni--0.0269 Nb--0.3288 Cr), expressed as
molar fractions. Based on [DICTRA simulations](#keller-2018), this work
considers enrichment of interdendritic regions to compositions between
(Ni--0.1659 Nb--0.2473 Cr) and (Ni--0.1726 Nb--0.2967 Cr).

Free energies for each constituent phase are computed using a CALPHAD database,
simplified from [Du *et al.*](#du-2005) to enable one-to-one mapping of
sublattice compositions to system compositions. This modified database is
[provided](Du_Cr-Nb-Ni_simple.tdb). The CALPHAD expressions are further
simplified using 2<sup>nd</sup>-order Taylor series (paraboloid) approximations.

Further details are provided in [src/README](src/README.md) and
[thermo/README](thermo/README.md).

## Install

This repository contains Python code to handle the CALPHAD database and C++ code
to perform the phase-field simulation. A Python 3 interpreter and C++11 compiler
are recommended. You will need to satisfy the following dependencies:

- Python
  - [Cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle)
  - [Dill](https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill)
  - [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/)
  - [PyCALPHAD](http://pycalphad.readthedocs.io/)
  - [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/)
  - [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/)
  - [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/)

- C++
  - [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
  - [MMSP](https://github.com/mesoscale/mmsp)
  - [matplotlib-cpp](https://github.com/tkphd/matplotlib-cpp/tree/develop) (submodule)

After downloading MMSP, please set the environmental variable `MMSP_PATH`
to its location. If you are using `bash`, do something similar to

```bash
$ echo "MMSP_PATH=~/Downloads/mmsp" >> ~/.bashrc
$ . ~/.bashrc
```

You will also want to build the MMSP utilities, as described in the MMSP
documentation.

## Usage

2. `make`. This will compile the source code into a binary, `src/alloy625`.
3. Run the code. Since your executable is built against `MMSP.main.hpp`,
   the options of that program apply to your binary. For usage suggestions,
   run `./alloy625 --help`. A typical MMSP run comprises two steps:
   initialization and update loops. So you would normally do:
   - `./alloy625 --example 2 data.dat`
   - `./alloy625 data.dat 10000000 1000000`
   - `mmsp2pvd data.dat data.*.dat` to generate VTK visualization
     files, then use a VTK viewer such as ParaView or Mayavi to see the
     results.
4. Remix, run, and analyze your own variants.
